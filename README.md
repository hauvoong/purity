## Testing ##
Manual testing on the site to ensure all links are working. 

## Validation ##

## Debugging ##

Navigation:
- Navbar is overlapping hero image

- Hero image on small devices was not aligned to navbar. Solution: About Img was max-width was too large. Changed max-width from 500 too 400px. 

- Adding button, title and description to hero carousel, the div would be very cramp on small screens. Solution was to hide text but not the button.
